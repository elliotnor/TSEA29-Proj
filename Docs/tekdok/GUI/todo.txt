Remember to write all functions ABOVE the mainloop() statement.

[x] fix circular import. Currently can't call functions that are in TSEA29_functions from TSEA29_GUI. We want to be able to call functions and have those functions modify values inside TSEA29_GUI.
POSSIBLE FIX: write everything in the same file. Easiest, but doesn't look good.

[] write all functions and get the buttons to actually do something with these functions when pressed. 

[x] remove all buttons to do with rotation

[] (Optional) Divide project into classes

[] write labels for status-frame.
    Speed. (Servo speed)
    Distance (Fwd, Left, Right)
    Connection Status

[] investigate if it is possible for a button to stay active only during the duration that it is being pressed. This is so that the car will turn as long as it this button is being pressed.
    [] implement the above described feature.

    OR 

[x] investigate if the main window is able to listen for keyklicks during a duration instead.
    [] implement the above described feature.

    In-GUI button-press binds arrowkeys to functions. Clicking that button again UNBINDS these keys, giving the illusion that the program only listens when we want it to.
